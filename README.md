ðŸ‘“ Unofficial Netflix app (A little better?)

## Prepare

This application needs to make the configuration file first. The contents are related to [this](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-widevine-cdm-plugin.md#using-widevine-cdm-plugin).

For example, if you installed Chrome using **Homebrew cask**, it would look something like this.

##### `~/.netfri.json`

```json
{
  "widevineCDMPath": "/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/google-chrome/latest/Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/57.0.2987.98/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Libraries/WidevineCdm/_platform_specific/mac_x64/widevinecdmadapter.plugin",
  "widevineCDMVersion": "1.4.8.970"
}
```

It's "chrome: // plugins" in the method of examining Version, but maybe you may be "chrome: // components" ðŸ˜µ

## Usage

The icon in the upper right is like this.

- pin / Do always on top
- eye / Adjust opacity
- hamburger / Show mylist  
  Clicking the poster in the list closes my-list and starts playing that title in the view on the left.
